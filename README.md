# godot-things
A repo for playing around with the Godot game engine.

Many of the scenes in the "Scenes" folder are just named after elements in the order of the tutorials I followed since I thought it was neat. Sub-scenes designed to be stored in other scenes are specifically in their own folder. Once mini demos started getting bigger, I started giving their own folders in the sub-scenes folder, such as 2D Platformer.
